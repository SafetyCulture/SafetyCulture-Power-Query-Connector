The SafetyCulture General Report Template gives Power BI analysts a head start with the SafetyCulture Data with pre-built custom columns, measures, and visuals.

## Getting started

Upon opening the template, a datasource type will need to be selected. If the SafetyCulture Power Query connector is being used, an API token will need to be provided (documentation [here](https://help.safetyculture.com/en-US/000155/)). If the SafetyCulture Exporter was used and the data was exported to CSV or SQL, the appropriate parameters for the datasource will need to be input before clicking Connect.
